## Projects

### Cyber Summer with FCCG
We're working with UOG and GDOE to get FCC into their Cyber Summer summer camp. More information [here](https://github.com/Chovin/FreeCodeCampGuamHelp/tree/master/CyberSummer)

### Prepare for island-wide launch
Get everything ready for our island-wide launch. This includes Familiarizing ourselves with the materials and community of FCC so that we can be good hosts for our new members once we invite the general public.

#### Learning Trail
We would like to have a more structured course for our weekly campsite meetings.  
So far we've only decided that we'll be going through 4 lessons a week and that we'll be explaining them during the campsite meetings if anybody needs help. We'll be recording the discussions in order to help the people that join later.

#### DOCOMO FCC Kids
In preparation for island-wide launch, soon we'd like to invite your kids to join FCC too.  
Hopefully it's something fun you can do with your kids.  
It'll also help us with learning how to teach and communicate about code, preparing for the summer camp and island-reveal.
